              Gravity has never been more necessary for successful companies as it is now. First of all, as work moves to a remote format, men and women that are used to asking questions in person and receiving immediate answers are still demanding quick responses in the form of Slack messages. As someone with the answers, this means you are going to spend hours every day just monitoring Slack. Second, there have been major advancements in deep learning over the past few years that allow machine learning models to understand English better than ever before. The result of this is that our question and answer pairing technology is extremely accurate. While your employees may not trust current answering bots because they are constantly providing poor answers, that is not the case with Gravity.

              Our vision is to be your companyâ€™s backbone, providing much needed support day and night without you even thinking twice. We will do this by building more and more integrations that will feed data into our platform. By doing so, you will have access to all of your documentation, best practices, common systems, in one place. Not only that, but you will be able to make edits to this data and it will edit it across your company.

              As the world moves faster and faster, businesses need to cut out decelerators to keep up. The more time you waste answering questions you have already answered countless times, the more time your competitors have to surpass you. Instead, let us take care of onboarding, daily enablement, and more so that you can get back to doing what you love!
